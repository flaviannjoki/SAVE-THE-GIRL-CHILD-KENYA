	<p class="ABOUTUS">ABOUT SAVE THE GIRL CHILD KENYA:</p>
	Save the girl child Kenya was created to educate the girl child about the physiology of menstruation, the do's and don'ts during menstruation and we are working on providing access to sanitary resources for those who lack due to certain limitations.<i style="color:yellow;"> Did you know</i> 65% of women and girls are unable to afford sanitary pads?
			The following are a number of limitations the girl child in kenya faces in search of sanitary resources during menstruation:<ol>
			<li>Poverty or lack of enough finances to cater for their needs.</li>
			<li>Living in remote areas that rarely access sanitary pads.</li>
			<li>Lack of an education on menstrual physiology that helps you prepare for menstruation cycles and health practices to undergo during the period.(<i style="color:yellow;">Did you know</i> a shocking percentage of  teachers are uncomfortable teaching about the menstrual physiology, then where should our girls get the information.?)</li>
		</ol>
			
			<i style="color:yellow;">Did you know</i> only 50% of the girl child in kenya openly talks about menstruation?We should normalize discussing menstruation and good menstrual hygiene and practices since it affects the girl child for basically most part of her life. Given that menstruation happens for over 30 years in a girl child's life, provision of menstrual phsyiology education and provision of menstruation resources  should be greatly prioritized.Lack of sanitary resources come with a number of negative effects on the girl child, they include:
				<ol>
					<li>Missing of classes during the menstrual cycle that negatively affect the performance of the child</li>
					<li>lack of concentration during the menstrual cycle</li>
					<li>Withdrawal embarassment and shame</li>
					<li>Engaging in immoral activities to gain access to funds to buy sanitary pads or menstrual cups</li>
				</ol>
			
				Some counties are greatly affected than others,<i style="color:yellow;"> a case study was done in wajir</i> and most girls have no access to sanitary pads or menstrual cups due to limited finances and some are in a location that is too interior they travel lots of kilometers to access sanitary pads or menstrual cups.Save the girl child Kenya will be targeting these areas first before spreading the charity work to better off areas
				<br><br>
				<i style="color:black; background-color:whitesmoke; font-weight:bolder;">SANITARY PADS VS MENSTRUAL CUPS:</i>
				<br>
				Menstrual cups have been lately introduced to counter sanitary pads since they have an upper hand in terms of durability.Sanitary pads are used and disposed off but then the menstrual cups are washed regularly and some can be used for upto 10 years. The menstrual cup is pocket friendly since it is buy once and use many times as possible.Hence we aim at donating both sanitary pads but mostly menstrual cups to needy girls in the society, to help counter this problem in our society.
